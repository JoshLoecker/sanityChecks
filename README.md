# Sanity Checks

This program will perform a series of sanity checks on constraint-based metabolic models. The information used in this
program is based on the following CobraToolbox tutorials:

- [Test physiologically relevant ATP yields from different carbon sources for a metabolic model
  ](https://opencobra.github.io/cobratoolbox/stable/tutorials/tutorialModelATPYield.html)
- [Testing basic properties of a metabolic model (aka sanity checks)
  ](https://opencobra.github.io/cobratoolbox/stable/tutorials/tutorialModelSanityChecks.html)
- [Testing chemical and biochemical fidelity
  ](https://opencobra.github.io/cobratoolbox/stable/tutorials/tutorialFidelityTesting.html)
